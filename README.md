# Coding Python

From competitive coding puzzles, data structures, algorithms to interview questions: everything in Python.

## Algorithms

- [Linear Search](dsa/linear_search.py)

A linear search or sequential search is a method for finding an element within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.

- [Binary Search](dsa/binary_search.py)

Binary search, also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array.

- [Insertion Sort](dsa/insertion_sort.py)

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

## Data Structures

- [Singly Linked List Implementation](dsa/singly_linked_list.py)

A linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence. In its most basic form, each node contains: data, and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration.

- [Stack Implementation](dsa/stack.py)

A stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two main principal operations:

- Push, which adds an element to the collection, and
- Pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.

The order in which elements come off a stack gives rise to its alternative name, LIFO (last in, first out). Additionally, a peek operation may give access to the top without modifying the stack.
